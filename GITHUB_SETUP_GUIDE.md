git status
```

### 2. Add all files to staging:

git add .
```

### 3. Commit your changes with a descriptive message:
```bash
git commit -m "Initial commit: Complete dataset analyzer with modern frontend, Flask backend, and AI integration"
```

### 4. Create a new repository on GitHub:
- Go to https://github.com/new
- Repository name: `dataset-analyzer` (or your preferred name)
- Description: "A modern web application for AI-powered dataset analysis"
- Choose public or private
- **DO NOT** initialize with README (you already have one)
- Click "Create repository"

### 5. Add the remote repository:
```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/dataset-analyzer.git
```
Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` with your GitHub username.

### 6. Push your code to GitHub:
```bash
git push -u origin main
```

### 7. Verify the push was successful:
```bash
git remote -v
git log --oneline
```

## Alternative: Using GitHub CLI (if installed)

### 1. Create repository with GitHub CLI:
```bash
gh repo create dataset-analyzer --description "A modern web application for AI-powered dataset analysis" --public
```

### 2. Push your code:
```bash
git push -u origin main
```

## Important Notes

1. **Before pushing**, make sure you have:
   - Created a `.env` file with your Groq API key (this is in .gitignore)
   - Tested the application locally
   - Verified all files are working correctly

2. **Files that won't be pushed** (due to .gitignore):
   - `.env` file with API keys
   - `uploads/` directory with user datasets
   - `dataset/` virtual environment
   - Any sensitive data files

3. **Recommended testing before pushing**:
   - Test file upload functionality
   - Verify Flask server starts correctly
   - Check frontend-backend communication
   - Test question-answering functionality

## Post-Push Steps

1. **Add a license** (optional):
   - Go to your repository on GitHub
   - Click "Add file" → "Create new file"
   - Name it `LICENSE`
   - Choose a license template (MIT recommended)

2. **Set up GitHub Pages** (if you want to deploy):
   - Go to repository Settings → Pages
   - Select source: GitHub Actions
   - Follow the setup instructions

3. **Add collaborators** (if needed):
   - Go to repository Settings → Collaborators
   - Add team members

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:
- **Authentication**: Make sure you're logged into GitHub on your terminal
- **Permissions**: Verify you have write access to the repository
- **Large files**: Check if any large files need to be handled with Git LFS

Your project is now ready to be shared on GitHub! The repository will include:
- Modern frontend interface (HTML, CSS, JS)
- Flask backend API
- Dataset analysis capabilities
- AI integration with Groq
- Comprehensive documentation
